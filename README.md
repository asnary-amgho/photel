Hi this app will take an screenshot
 send it to your telegram with just pressing one key
actually two keys at once "shift"+"`" 
the last one that seems weird is backtick 
so its gonna ask you a bunch of questions about token bot that you have
and the user or channel id that you can send pics
and then the path that you wanna save it incase it did not send it (if it sent the pic it get deleted)
